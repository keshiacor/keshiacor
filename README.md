👩🏽‍💻 I'm a dedicated software engineer who combines technical expertise with a passion for building products that are intuitive and make a difference. Skilled in JavaScript, Ruby, React, Restful APIs and backend development to name a few, I bring a customer-centric approach from years of customer-facing experience to solving complex problems and curiosity.
