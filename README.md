👩🏽‍💻 I'm a dedicated software engineer who combines technical expertise with a passion for creating inclusive and impactful work environments. Skilled in JavaScript, Ruby, Restful APIs and backend development to name a few, I bring a customer-centric approach from years of customer-facing experience to solving complex problems and curiosity. I love being mentored and mentoring others.
