👩‍💻 I'm a software developer who is currently working as the team lead of the technical support and escalation team at Thinkific! Thin- ki- what, haha I know, it's not you, let's try that slooooowwly:  Thin- ki -fic.
I love exploring new things and there's always something new in the 🌍 of technology. 
## My Stack and knowledge
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Node, Ruby, Ruby On Rails (still dabbling in this one), PHP, SQL, GraphQL, Java, C++, Git, GitHub , Unit testing, Express, PostgreSQL, XML, Python (more to dabble into), jQuery, mySQL

## Fun facts about me
-  🤓 I'm a curious individual so I'm always learning something new - 2025 is my year of Rails so my commits may look different starting at the end of Q1
-  🧩 I love solving puzzles - the technical kind 🕵️‍♀️ and real puzzles
-  🎓 Graduated from a Computer Science degree -- here's a cool fact, when I started in CS, ES6 was no where near out yet + I know COBOL from my days at Vanier College 🤣
-  🔭 I'm currently working on improving my [JamSess Spotify app](https://jamsess.netlify.app/), a todo list app and some API + SQL work - oh did I mention I am a back-end enthusiast 🤩
-  💟 I spent years working in customer facing roles because I wanted to better understand what customers needed and how to help them , I truly believe that experience helps me bring a         unique perspective to software development 
-  💃 Lover of Salsa, bachata and music
-  🔍 Something in my projects caught your attention? Feel to slide me a comment, email or message, I'm like an excited toddler when I get feedback
