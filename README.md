👩🏽‍💻 I'm a dedicated software engineer who combines technical expertise with a passion for building products that are intuitive and make a difference. Skilled in JavaScript, Ruby, React, Restful APIs and backend development to name a few, I bring a customer-centric approach from years of customer-facing experience to solving complex problems and curiosity.

## Fun facts about me
-  🧩 Currently working on a passion project: **The Travel Diaries** - a full stack journaling app where users can record their travel experience as a journal entry, take pictures/upload their pictures, and save new places to visit in their wish list. They can then share those experiences with friends. Watch me build it in public on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/keshia-coriolan) 
-  🤓 I'm a curious individual so I'm always learning something new - in 2025 I'm diving more into on Ruby On Rails.
-  Salsa and bachata dancer 💃🏽
-  Currently started writing and sharing my knowledge on Medium
